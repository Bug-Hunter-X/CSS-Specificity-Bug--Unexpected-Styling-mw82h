The CSS specificity can sometimes lead to unexpected styling issues.  For example, consider the following:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: red;
}

p.special {
  color: green;
}

<p class="special">This is some text.</p>
```

You might expect the text to be green, due to the higher specificity of `p.special`. However, if there's another rule with even higher specificity (such as an inline style), it might override this, causing unexpected behavior. This makes debugging difficult, as the specificity is not immediately obvious.
