To solve the specificity problem, we can make sure our important styles are more specific or use the `!important` flag (although this is generally not recommended for maintainability).  Here is a possible solution:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: red;
}

/* Using !important is not always the best option */
p.special {
  color: green !important;
}

/* Or add more specific rule if possible */
.special p {
    color: green;
}

<p class="special">This is some text.</p>
```

By adding `!important` or a more specific rule, we ensure that the intended style (`green`) is applied correctly. However, overuse of `!important` can lead to maintenance problems and should be avoided when possible.  The ideal is to use specific CSS selectors to avoid such issues.
